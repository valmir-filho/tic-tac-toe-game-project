## Instructions:



Objective:

The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to form a line of three marks (X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.
Players:

The game is played between two players.
One player will play as X and the other as O.
Starting the Game:

At the start of the game, an empty 3x3 grid will appear on the screen.
Player X always goes first.
How to Play:

Each player takes turns clicking on an empty cell in the grid.
Player X clicks on a cell to place their mark (X), followed by Player O who clicks to place their mark (O).
Players continue to alternate turns until one player wins or the board is full.
Winning the Game:

A player wins if they successfully place three of their marks (X or O) in a row.
The winning row can be:
Horizontally (across any row),
Vertically (down any column),
Diagonally (from corner to corner).
Tie Game:

If all cells on the grid are filled and neither player has formed a line of three, the game ends in a tie.
End of Game:

When a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a message will pop up showing the result (win or tie).
After this, the game will reset, and players can start again by clicking on any cell.
Additional Notes:
Only empty cells can be clicked. If you click on a cell that is already occupied, nothing will happen.
The game automatically resets after each round, so you can keep playing as many times as you like!
